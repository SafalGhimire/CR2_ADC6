O- OPEN/CLOSED PRINCIPLE:
â€œClasses should be open for extension but closed for modification"
                       Open for extensions means that the behaviour of the class can be extended without modidying the class and it can be achieved by Abstraction.
For e.g.
       Shipped phones comes with the basic like camera operation,actual calls, text message, etc
	   But via the app store, you can extend the phone's capabilities to allow you to manage your to do list etc.
	   Your phone's core system (kernel OS) code are closed for the modification.
