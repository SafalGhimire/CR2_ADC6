 Interfaces should contain only the necessary methods and not anything
  else.
IBirdInterface
• This interface has many bird behaviors along with fly () method. 
OstrichClass
• Say Ostrich class implements the IBirdInterface, it has to implement 
the fly() method unnecessarily(Ostrich doesn’t fly) 
  This violates ISP!!! 
SOLUTION:
• Split the interface into two different interfaces, INonFlyingBird 
and IFlyingBird.
IFlyingBird
• KingFisher will implements this interface. 
INonFlyingBird
• Ostrich class implements this interface.
