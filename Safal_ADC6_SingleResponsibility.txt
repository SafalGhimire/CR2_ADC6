Single Responsibility: A class should have one and only one responsibility
.(i.e one reason to change).
-One can clearly see that this product has not just one single 
responsibility.
-There are several responsibilities assembled in a single unit.
-Violation of Single Responsibility
priniciple.
For example:
Let’s take the class A which does the following operations:
1. Open a database connection
2. Fetch data from database
3. Write the data in an external file.
 Class A violates SRP.
 • Problems:
- Class A handles lot of operations.
Suppose any of the following change happens in future like :
1. New database
2. Adopt ORM to manage queries in the database
3. Change in output structure
• So in all the cases the above class would be changed.
• Which might affect the implementation of the other two operations as
well.
• Solution:
• So ideally according to SRP there should be three classes
each having the single responsibility.
